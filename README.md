# Java Refresh Exercises

This repository contains **simple Java exercises** created with the purpose of **refreshing and reinforcing core programming concepts**.

Although the exercises are basic, they demonstrate:
- Clean coding practices.
- Code organization and version control with Git.
- Commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

## Purpose

Even with professional experience in software development, I believe it is essential to regularly review the fundamentals in order to:
- Write cleaner and more efficient code.
- Stay prepared for technical challenges and interviews.
- Keep problem-solving and logical thinking sharp.

## Contents

- Control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`)
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Collections manipulation (`List`, `Map`, `Set`)
- Algorithm and logic practice exercises
